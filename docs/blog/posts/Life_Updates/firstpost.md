# Welcome to the blog!

Hey everyone!

<!-- more -->

I'm trying to start something new here. I know blogs are a thing of the past and this might just go into becoming AI fodder. But, I have hopes that I might do something good here. If not for anyone else then for myself.

Anyway I hope to learn a lot of stuff while I'm trying to document them here. Some of them will include:
- Python
- Mkdocs
- ML / Deep Learning

I have done a few AI projects in the past but all of that is somewhere locked in a memory cabinet which I'm not able to find. With this, I'll try to find that and hopefully unlock it all. Who knows I might even expand it. 

This is the first post in what should be a hopefully long series of posts. But lets face it, it will probably not be. I myself will be very surprised if it ends up being a slightly regular thing if at all. 

I hope you enjoy this very shortlived journey with me! :fontawesome-solid-hand-peace:
