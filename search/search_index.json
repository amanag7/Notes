I know blogs are a thing of the past and this might just go into becoming AI fodder. But, I have hopes that I might do something good here. If not for anyone else then for myself.</p> <p>Anyway I hope to learn a lot of stuff while I'm trying to document them here. Some of them will include: - Python - Mkdocs - ML / Deep Learning</p> <p>I have done a few AI projects in the past but all of that is somewhere locked in a memory cabinet which I'm not able to find. With this, I'll try to find that and hopefully unlock it all. Who knows I might even expand it. </p> <p>This is the first post in what should be a hopefully long series of posts. But lets face it, it will probably not be. I myself will be very surprised if it ends up being a slightly regular thing if at all. </p> <p>I hope you enjoy this very shortlived journey with me! </p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
